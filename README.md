For this lab I created two constructors. One constructor for each data in a list or a 'node' and I created one to construct a list. Then I append nodes to the back by setting the head to the current node. Then I set the new node to the current nodes next. For the prepend function it sets the current head to a variable. Then I create a new node and set the first value as the new node and I create the second node as the original head node. For the reverse method I make sure I am not working with an empty list then I set pointers. I set the head as one of the pointers then I go through each pointer and set their value to the opposite of how the original list's pointers were organized. For the last method of remove if their is no length of the list it will throw err otherwise if you want to remove the first node in the list I set the head as the current's next node and then with the current node I set it to null and remove it and decrease the length. Then I have a while block that makes the prior node to the currentNode and the next of the current node null then remove the current node. To test this create a new list and a new node which will be the head then call the methods on the list with a value passed on in the parentheses to see that value added.
