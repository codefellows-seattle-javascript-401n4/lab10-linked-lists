====


    To use SinglyLinkedList:
    `const SLL = require ('./lib/LinkedList');`
    * accessing each method

    * running your tests


## Bonus Points:
  * 2pts
  * implement `findNthNodeFromEnd(n)` as a method on the SLL prototype
    * takes `n` as an input/argument, representing the offset from the end to return
    * returns the nth node from the end (opposite of head) of the list
  * implement `findMiddleNode()` as a pure method on the SLL prototype
    * returns the middle node within the list
