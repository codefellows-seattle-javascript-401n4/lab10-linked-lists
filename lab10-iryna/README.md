#### Feature Tasks  
* implemented a Singly Linked List (SLL) data structor  
* implemented `append(takes values, appends)`, `prepend(value)`, `reverse()`, and `remove(offset)` methods to the SLL prototype
* added Big-O runtime in comments
* wrote tests for `append(value)`, `prepend(value)`, and `remove(offset)`

## Bonus Points:
  * 2pts
  * implement `findNthNodeFromEnd(n)` as a method on the SLL prototype
    * takes `n` as an input/argument, representing the offset from the end to return
    * returns the nth node from the end (opposite of head) of the list
  * implement `findMiddleNode()` as a pure method on the SLL prototype
    * returns the middle node within the list

#### Rubric:
  * Tests: 2pts
  * Passes linter: 1pts
  * Completed Data Structure: 5pts
  * Big-O notation: 2pt
